<h2>Dish with aubergines, perfect with rice</h2>
<p>Fry aubergines on olive oil, fry sweet pepper  Fry onion, add to it peeled and cutted into small pieces tomatoes, add salt and pepper. After a couple of minutes add the fried aubergines and pepper. Take out from from stove. Add fresh koriandr. You can add fresh garlic to it. Bon appetite!
I usually prefer to peel the aubergines and cut them in slices and fry for both sides. The sweet pepper I cut in small squares. I also like to fry everything in olive oil, usually with olive oil it is tastier, but it is up to you how to cut and fry.</p>
